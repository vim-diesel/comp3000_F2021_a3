Collaborators:

1. The command `mkfs.ext4 ...` is potentially dangerous because we could reformat the wrong disk and lose data, or delete the OS.


2. cd into the 3000fs folder and run `sudo chroot .`


3. "BusyBox is a software suite that provides several Unix utilities in a single executable file." (Wikipedia)
BusyBox is being executed to run a bourne (sh) shell. 

"ldconfig creates the necessary links and cache to the most recent shared libraries" (man pages)
Running ldconfig links the libraries. 

Then, mounting the proc filesystem so that processes are available to our new shell. proc is a special filesystem. 
"The  proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to kernel data structures.  It is com‐
       monly mounted at /proc.  Typically, it is mounted automatically by the system, but it can also be mounted man‐
       ually using a command such as:

           mount -t proc proc /proc
" (man proc)



4. If the script is being re-run, then this checks if the directory already exists. It then proceeds to unmount and delete the filesystem.
